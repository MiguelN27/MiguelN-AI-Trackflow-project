"""Turning failures into responses a person can act on.

Three things this module exists to prevent. A malformed payload must not come
back as FastAPI's default 422 with a list of pydantic error dictionaries: the
incident manager owes the caller a 400 with one named field and a sentence. A
business rule refusal must say which field it was about. And an unhandled
exception must never reach the client as a traceback - the response says only
that something went wrong, while the detail goes to the log.

Every handler here is registered on the app in `services.main`. They take a
bare `Exception` because that is the signature Starlette's handler registry
declares; each one narrows to the type it was registered for and hands anything
unexpected to the generic 500, so a misregistration degrades instead of
crashing.
