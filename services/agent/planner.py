"""Source planning: which sources a question needs, decided by the model.

The generation model is shown the three source tools - `lookup_ticket`,
`lookup_stock`, `search_knowledge_base` - with JSON schemas generated from
their typed contracts, and must call at least one (`tool_choice="required"`).
It only *chooses*: the graph runs each chosen source as its own node.

A fourth tool, `note_team_update` (MEM-092), is not a source: it marks a
message in which the user *tells* something - a carrier correction, the cause of
recurring incidents, a client's report preference - so that a message with no
evidence still reaches the generation call, whose self-evaluation may propose
remembering it. It sets `Plan.user_update` and adds no step.

What the model returns is checked before anything runs, and every call that is
dropped is recorded with its reason in `Plan.ignored`:

- an unknown tool, arguments that are not JSON or break the contract, or a
  second call to the same tool;
- a ticket reference that does not appear in the question, so the model cannot
  invent a ticket to look up.

The surviving steps run in `SOURCE_ORDER` (live data first). With no usable
step, or when the model cannot be reached, the plan falls back to the
knowledge base alone - the Part 1 behaviour - with the reason recorded. The
planner never raises for a model failure.

manager - a ticket's status, category, dates or details, or which tickets match a \
status, category, origin or branch.
- lookup_stock: the live stock of a product in the inventory manager - whether \
there is stock and how many units, optionally in one warehouse.
- search_knowledge_base: TrackFlow's documented knowledge - policies, procedures, \
services, prices, carriers, delivery times, contacts and who is responsible for what.
- note_team_update: the user is telling you something rather than only asking - a \
correction to a carrier's coverage or routes, the known cause of recurring incidents or \
delays, or a B2B client's preference for their monthly report. It is not a source: call \
it together with the source that can check the update (search_knowledge_base for \
carrier coverage, lookup_ticket for the incidents mentioned).

Call every tool the question needs, and only those: a question about a ticket's \
status and about a policy needs both lookup_ticket and search_knowledge_base. Live \
data such as a ticket's status or current stock is never in the knowledge base, and \
policies or procedures are never in the incident or inventory manager. Copy ticket \
references and product names exactly as the user wrote them, and never invent a \
reference the question does not contain. If no tool fits, call search_knowledge_base.\
