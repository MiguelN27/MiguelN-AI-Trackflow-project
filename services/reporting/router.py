"""Business reporting endpoints, backed by the pipelines in `data/pipelines/`.

HTTP only: parse, call `data.pipelines`, map errors to status codes. Whether a
week was computed, what it holds and how a run starts are decided there; no
pipeline logic is duplicated here. This module is separate from
`services/telemetry/`, and imports nothing from it: `GET /telemetry/report`
keeps serving engineering, this serves the business.

All three routes take a bearer token, like `/inventory` and `/suppliers`:
per-client volumes are commercially sensitive (design Q6). Responses expose no
person: the triggering user's UUID is stored on the run, never returned.
