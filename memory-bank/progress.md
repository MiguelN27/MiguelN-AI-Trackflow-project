## Update 2026-09-19

Goals accomplished:
- Ran the mandatory memory-bank reading sequence before work: `context.md`, `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Built the Supplier Directory frontend in `uis/backoffice`, consuming the FastAPI service in `services/suppliers` at `http://localhost:8000`:
	- Foundation: `types/supplier.ts` (unions, `SUPPLIER_CATEGORIES`, `CURRENCY_BY_COUNTRY`), `types/async-state.ts`, `lib/api-client.ts`, `lib/supplier.ts` (labels, rate formatting, `validateSupplierForm`, `buildSupplierPayload`, payload normalization), `services/suppliers-service.ts` (list, detail, create, rate patch, status patch).
	- Shared UI and navigation: `components/common/StateMessage.tsx`, new `components/common/BackofficeNav.tsx` (Dashboard / Suppliers with `usePathname` active-link state) wired into `app/layout.tsx`, and `components/suppliers/SupplierStatusBadge.tsx`.
	- List and filters: `app/suppliers/page.tsx` plus `SuppliersListPage`, with server-side country/category filtering persisted to the URL via `router.replace(..., { scroll: false })`, and inline `SupplierRateEditor` / `SupplierStatusToggle` that swap the edited row in state from the API response instead of refetching the list.
	- Create form: `SupplierCreateForm` with client validation first and currency auto-derived from country as a read-only field.
	- Detail view: `app/suppliers/[id]/page.tsx` (Next.js 16 async `params`) plus `SupplierDetailPage`, reusing the same rate editor and status toggle.
	- Configuration: `.env.local` and `.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `next dev -p 3001` so the backoffice does not collide with `uis/website` on port 3000, and a new `typecheck` script.
- Centralized FastAPI error handling in `lib/api-client.ts`, covering both response shapes: `{ detail: string }` for 404 and the `{ detail: [{ loc, msg, type }] }` validation array for 422, which is flattened into a readable `field: message` string.
- Executed formatting with auto-fix: `npm run lint -- --fix` in `uis/backoffice` (clean).
- Executed typechecking: `npm run typecheck` in `uis/backoffice` (clean), and `npm run build` succeeded with `/suppliers` prerendered and `/suppliers/[id]` server-rendered on demand.
- Attempted the test suite; `uis/backoffice` still has no `test` script, unchanged from the 2026-08-23 entry.
- Verified the feature end to end against the running API and a headless browser: 15 rows listed, Laser Ship and SAP WM Cloud rendered as suspended, `country=Spain` returning 6 rows and `category=carrier_international` returning 2 without a page reload, supplier creation succeeding and a 422 surfacing in the form, and rate/status edits updating the row immediately and persisting across a refresh. Data created during verification was removed afterwards, leaving the seeded directory at 15 suppliers.

Future goals / still missing:
- Define and standardize test scripts (`test`) across root and UI packages so pre-commit test validation can run consistently.
- Add baseline automated tests for `lib/api-client.ts` error extraction, `lib/supplier.ts` validation and payload building, and the suppliers service layer.
- Refresh `techContext.md`, whose "Current consumed endpoints" section still describes only the `uis/website` `/records` API and does not yet mention the suppliers service or the backoffice UI.
- Decide whether the backoffice needs pagination, supplier deletion, editing of name/country/categories, and authentication, all of which were deliberately excluded from this iteration.

## Update 2026-08-23

Goals accomplished:
- Ran the mandatory memory-bank reading sequence before work: `context.md`, `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Executed formatting with auto-fix in both UI apps:
	- `npm --prefix uis/website run lint -- --fix`
	- `npm --prefix uis/backoffice run lint -- --fix`
- Executed typechecking in both UI apps:
	- `npx tsc --noEmit` in `uis/website`
	- `npx tsc --noEmit` in `uis/backoffice`
- Attempted to run test suites at root and UI-app levels; no `test` script is currently defined in these `package.json` files.

Future goals / still missing:
- Define and standardize test scripts (`test`) across root and UI packages so pre-commit test validation can run consistently.
- Add at least baseline automated tests (unit/integration) for critical UI service and normalization layers.

## Executive Summary

The project has a solid foundation on the frontend side, with two clear deliverables already implemented:

1. A branded static marketing website in `apps/website` (homepage + signup flow + client-side validation).
2. A functional Next.js operations UI in `uis/website` with candidate and notes CRUD interactions against an external API.

This means the project is already demonstrating product thinking, UI execution, and service-layer integration patterns. However, compared to TrackFlow's business objectives, most logistics-core capabilities (warehouse unification, carrier intelligence, returns automation, CX automation, telemetry, and executive dashboards) are still pending and currently represented mostly as narrative/UX framing rather than implemented business systems.

## Current State by Project Objective

### 1) Unified operational backbone (Mexico + Spain)

Status: In progress (early stage)

What exists:
- A typed frontend architecture that can consume external operational records (`/records` endpoints).
- Normalization utilities in `uis/website/lib/candidate.ts` and `uis/website/lib/notes.ts` that tolerate schema variations.

What's missing:
- No in-repo unified inventory model/API.
- No warehouse, carrier, returns, or ERP integration implementation.
- No shared domain model yet for TrackFlow logistics entities in `packages/shared/types/index.ts` (currently placeholder types only).

### 2) Reduce manual work through automation

Status: Not started for core logistics automation

What exists:
- Form validation and UI workflows (candidate management, notes).
- Signup form validation in `apps/website/signup.js`.

What's missing:
- No implemented automation workflows for order ingestion, carrier selection, tracking updates, return approvals, or weekly executive reports.
- `workflows/` exists structurally but automation pipelines are not implemented.

### 3) Improve decision-making with real-time dashboards

Status: Early UI groundwork

What exists:
- Tracker UI includes list/search/filter and detail views that simulate dashboard-like workflow for candidate operations.
- Branded visual system and reusable status UI component (`StateMessage`).

What's missing:
- No real-time operational KPIs (shipments, delivery performance, returns, CSAT, costs).
- No telemetry/data pipeline feeding dashboards.
- No executive dashboard implementation.

### 4) Increase service quality with proactive support

Status: Not started (business capability)

What exists:
- Branded web presence and contact/signup pathways.

What's missing:
- No bilingual support agent.
- No RAG knowledge base.
- No unified ticketing model.
- No proactive alerting or sentiment analysis.

### 5) Strengthen scalability and resilience

Status: Foundation only

What exists:
- Separation of concerns: static site, Next.js UI, service layer, normalization helpers.
- Strict TypeScript setup in the Next.js UI and clear API abstraction via `api-client.ts`.

What's missing:
- No centralized logging/monitoring.
- No health checks, no alerting, no incident workflow automation.
- No deployment pipeline or runtime observability standards documented.

## Implemented Assets (Verified)

### Product/UI Deliverables

- `apps/website/index.html`
	- Corporate landing page aligned to TrackFlow narrative.
	- SEO/social metadata + structured data.
	- Responsive layout and dark mode toggle.

- `apps/website/signup.html` + `apps/website/signup.js`
	- Multi-section onboarding form mapped to TrackFlow operational realities.
	- Client-side validation with inline feedback and accessibility attributes.

- `uis/website`
	- Candidate list page with load/error/success states.
	- Search + filter by status/stage via query params.
	- Candidate creation modal (POST `/records`).
	- Candidate detail page with:
		- Status/stage update (PATCH `/records/:id`)
		- Full profile update (PUT `/records/:id`)
		- Notes list/create/delete (`/records/:id/notes`)

### Technical Building Blocks

- `uis/website/lib/api-client.ts`
	- Base URL handling and request wrapper.
	- Centralized HTTP error handling.

- `uis/website/lib/candidate.ts`
	- Payload normalization and flexible field mapping.
	- Candidate form validation and data transformation helpers.

- `uis/website/lib/notes.ts`
	- Notes payload normalization from multiple possible API shapes.

- `uis/website/services/*.ts`
	- Service-layer abstraction for API calls.

## Gaps and Risks Right Now

1. Backend dependency risk:
- The tracker requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and external endpoints; without them, flows break at runtime.

2. Domain mismatch risk:
- Current implemented app domain is "talent pipeline" while business objectives focus on logistics operations. The architecture is reusable, but domain alignment work is still needed.

3. Data contract instability risk:
- Extensive field normalization suggests upstream payloads may be inconsistent; this can slow feature velocity and increase bugs.

4. Delivery risk for later milestones:
- No telemetry, pipeline, RAG, agent, or workflow implementations yet, which are required for mid/late milestones.

## Recommended Next Steps

## Phase 1 (Immediate: 3-5 days) - Align scope and unblock end-to-end delivery

1. Define the canonical TrackFlow domain schema in `packages/shared/types/index.ts`.
2. Decide if `uis/website` will be repurposed to logistics entities (recommended) or kept as a separate demo UI.
3. Create a minimal backend contract document for:
	 - inventory
	 - shipments/tracking
	 - carriers
	 - returns
	 - tickets/CX
4. Add `.env.example` and setup docs for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and required endpoints.

Deliverable:
- Shared domain types + API contract v1 + environment setup baseline.

## Phase 2 (Near term: 1-2 weeks) - Build first logistics vertical slice

Target one complete workflow first:
- "Shipment tracking and incident visibility"

Scope:
1. Implement backend endpoints (or mock service if backend is out of scope this sprint).
2. Build a Next.js operations page for shipment list/detail and status timeline.
3. Add basic KPIs: on-time %, delayed shipments, incidents by carrier.
4. Add tests for service adapters and normalization logic.

Deliverable:
- One production-like vertical slice that maps directly to TrackFlow operations pain.

## Phase 3 (Following 2-4 weeks) - Add automation + observability

1. Workflow automation (n8n or script-based):
	 - scheduled weekly executive summary generation
	 - alerting for delivery delay thresholds
2. Telemetry baseline:
	 - structured logs
	 - API error-rate tracking
	 - basic health dashboard
3. Returns automation MVP:
	 - rule-based approval engine (start with deterministic rules)

Deliverable:
- First automation and observability capabilities tied to measurable ops impact.

## Phase 4 (After core ops baseline) - AI capabilities

1. RAG knowledge base for CX policies and SOPs (ES/EN).
2. Bilingual support assistant for top repetitive intents (tracking + return status).
3. Carrier recommendation assistant with transparent rule explanations.

Deliverable:
- AI features built on top of stable operational data and workflows.

## Priority Backlog (Ordered)

1. Canonical logistics data model + shared types.
2. Backend/API contract for core entities.
3. First operations dashboard vertical slice.
4. Automated weekly report generation.
5. Telemetry/monitoring foundation.
6. Returns automation MVP.
7. CX RAG + assistant.

## Suggested Definition of "Next Milestone Done"

The next milestone should be considered complete when all of the following are true:

1. At least one logistics workflow is fully functional end-to-end (UI + API + data).
2. KPI widgets are driven by real endpoint data (not static placeholders).
3. Errors and empty states are handled across list/detail views.
4. Minimum test coverage exists for data normalization and service layer logic.
5. A short runbook explains how to run frontend + API + environment locally.
