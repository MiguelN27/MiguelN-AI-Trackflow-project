# `data/raw` folder

This folder is intended for **raw data** related to the company: dumps, exports, sample files, event samples, or untransformed datasets.

- **Main purpose**: serve as a landing zone or reference for original data before pipelines process it.
- **Recommendation**: document each dataset’s origin, format, expected size, privacy/PII considerations, and how it is versioned (ideally avoiding sensitive data in the repository).

## In this folder

- `incidents-trackflow.csv`: the helpdesk export that `scripts/seed_incidents.py` seeds from.
- `prefect-results/` (git-ignored, created by the pipeline): Prefect's persisted results of the cached transform tasks (the four KPI tasks, the row assembly and collection health), the intermediate files behind the 1-hour cache. They hold counts per warehouse, client and week and collection stats, never event rows, event ids, payloads or user ids, and can be deleted at any time.
- `telemetry_<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv` (git-ignored, written by `scripts/nightly_export.py`): one UTC day of `telemetry_events`, exported once as a backup and audit snapshot, with the table's columns (`id,timestamp,event_type,payload,tags,created_at`). The pipeline reads the database, not these files. They carry pseudonymous user and session ids, which is why they stay out of git. See `docs/NIGHTLY_EXPORT.md`.
